# Hi, I'm Abhi 👋

I'm a startup-focused CTO, full-stack engineer, and founder passionate about building scalable platforms and high-impact teams. I currently lead [CoHost Podcasting](https://www.cohostpodcasting.com), a modern platform for podcast hosting, analytics, and audience growth.

Previously, I founded **Vacation Fund**, an employee benefits platform that helped companies contribute to their team's vacation goals - supporting rest, retention, and workplace happiness. We scaled the business through **Techstars Chicago**. Before that, I worked at a global non-profit, where I led the development of an international payments and ticketing system that powered hackathons across the world.
